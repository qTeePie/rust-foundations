    ✨ Structs ✨
    Structs lets us implement some object-oriented like functionality to our Rust programs.

    Similar to Structs in C, these are structures that can hold multiple related values in key:value pairs.

    -----
    **Important note on _Struct Update Syntax_**
    > Note that the struct update syntax uses = like an assignment;
    this is because it moves the data, just as we saw in the “Variables and Data Interacting with Move” section.
    In this example, we can no longer use user after creating user2 because the String in the username field of user was moved into user2.
    If we had given user2 new String values for both email and username, and thus only used the active and sign_in_count values from user,
    then user would still be valid after creating user2. Both active and sign_in_count are types that implement the Copy trait,
    so the behavior we discussed in the “Stack-Only Data: Copy” section would apply. We can also still use user.email in this example,
    because its value was not moved out of user.
    ----

    Tuple structs - hold multiple related fields like regular structs, but their fields dont have associated names.
    (Think RGB, Points, and similar 🎨)
