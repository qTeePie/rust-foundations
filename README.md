# 🦀 rust-foundations

> ⚠️ This is a practice repo. I’m learning by doing. Code is annotated casually for myself with a lot of silly remarks and emojis. 💅

Welcome to my Rust journey! 🚀 This repo is where I’m learning the core foundations of the Rust programming language by working through [_The Rust Book_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## 📚 Goal

To build a strong foundation in Rust — from variables and ownership to lifetimes, traits, and memory safety — with clear examples and mini projects along the way.

I'm learning Rust as a stepping stone toward understanding **zero-knowledge proofs (ZK)** and working on cutting-edge cryptographic projects in the blockchain space. 🧠💫

## 🛠️ Structure

This repo is organized by chapters or major concepts from _The Rust Programming Language_ book. Each folder contains hands-on code snippets, notes, and experiments.
