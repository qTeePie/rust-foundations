/*
    - Each value in Rust has an *owner*.
    - There can only be one owner at a time.
    - When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

    **String Type**
    The string type is more complex than the other, fixed size, data types such as uint32 etc.

    - String literals: hardcoded string values eg. let str = "I'm super static ğŸ¥±"
    - Strings: Data type suitable for dynamic strings, eg. user input.
        Since the size of these are not known at compile time, they are allocated on the heap.
        Declared like this: let str = String::from("U'll find me on the heap âœ¨")

    > A String is made up of three parts: a pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity.
    > This group of data is stored on the stack. The actual string content (where the pointer leads) is stored on the heap.

    When we assign s1 to s2, the **String data** is copied, meaning we copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack.
    **We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to.**

    When the owner of a piece of memory, goes out of scope, rust calls a function named *drop*
