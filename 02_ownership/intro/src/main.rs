/*
    - Each value in Rust has an *owner*.
    - There can only be one owner at a time.
    - When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

    **String Type**
    The string type is more complex than the other, fixed size, data types such as uint32 etc.

    - String literals: hardcoded string values eg. let str = "I'm super static ðŸ¥±"
    - Strings: Data type suitable for dynamic strings, eg. user input.
        Since the size of these are not known at compile time, they are allocated on the heap.
        Declared like this: let str = String::from("U'll find me on the heap âœ¨")
